# Battlecode 2022 Kyle, Daniel, Julian and Andrei

All files except for those in the folders bot1 and coordinatedBoi in src were part of the scaffold for the competition. bot1 and coodinatedBoi are different editions of our code, and each have a RobotPlayer.java file to run our bots.

This is the Battlecode 2022 scaffold, containing an `examplefuncsplayer`. Read https://play.battlecode.org/getting-started! 

### Project Structure

- `README.md`
    This file.
- `build.gradle`
    The Gradle build file used to build and run players.
- `src/`
    Player source code.
- `test/`
    Player test code.
- `client/`
    Contains the client. The proper executable can be found in this folder (don't move this!)
- `build/`
    Contains compiled player code and other artifacts of the build process. Can be safely ignored.
- `matches/`
    The output folder for match files.
- `maps/`
    The default folder for custom maps.
- `gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`
    The Unix (OS X/Linux) and Windows versions, respectively, of the Gradle wrapper. These are nifty scripts that you can execute in a terminal to run the Gradle build tasks of this project. If you aren't planning to do command line development, these can be safely ignored.
- `gradle/`
    Contains files used by the Gradle wrapper scripts. Can be safely ignored.


### Useful Commands

    Runs a game with the settings in gradle.properties
